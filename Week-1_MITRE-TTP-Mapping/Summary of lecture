From the lecture, I understood that malware analysis is the process of studying harmful software to know how it works,
where it comes from, and how it affects systems. We learned about different types of analysis—like static, dynamic, memory,
and behavioral—and how each helps in detecting and understanding malware. The lecture also explained the tools used,
such as IDA Pro, Wireshark, and Volatility, and common signs of malware activity like suspicious files, registry changes,
and unusual memory usage. A real example of ransomware was also discussed, which helped me understand how serious and 
dangerous malware can be.
